# Code for FlagVNE

> [!IMPORTANT]
> :sparkles: The foundation model of FlagVNE has been integrated into our benchmark [Virne](https://github.com/GeminiLight/virne)
> 
> :sparkles: You can easily run it with a specific solver name `ppo_bigcn+` or `ppo_gat+` in Virne!

## Installation

We recommend using CUDA devices to accelerate the training process. If you do not have a CUDA device, you can also use the CPU to run the code.

With GPU:
```shell
# use cuda (optional version: 10.2, 11.3)
bash install.sh -c 12.1
```

With CPU:
```shell
bash install.sh -c 0
```

## Quick Start

We provide several shell scripts to run the experiment conveniently.

You can customize the settings in the shell scripts.

Key settings in the shell scripts are as follows:

- `topology`:
  - Description: Name of topology
  - Options: [geant, wx100, wx500]
- `solver_name`:
  - Description: Name of solver
  - Options: 
    - Our algorithms: [flag_vne, flag_vne_meta_free_single_policy, flag_vne_meta_free_multi_policy, flag_vne_meta_policy, flag_vne_no_curriculum, flag_vne_unidirectional_action]
    - Baselines: [nrm_rank, nea_rank, pso_vne, mcts, a3c_gcn, pg_cnn, ddpg_attention]
    - Preliminary Study: [a3c_gcn, a3c_gcn_nrm, a3c_gcn_nea, a3c_gcn_multi_policies]
- `num_train_epochs`:
  - Description: Number of training epochs. If 0, then inference only.
  - Options: [0, >0]
- `use_pretrained_model`:
  - Description: Whether to use pretrained model. If 1, then inference only.
  - Options: [1, 0]
- `pretrained_model_path`:
  - Description: Path to the pretrained model. If inference, then the path must be valid.
  - Options: ['null', $path]
